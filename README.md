An IoT based, open-source, camera-feed system.

## Features
- TBD

## Installation
- TBD

## Systems Design
The system is designed to be modular, with each component being able to be swapped out for another. It comprises an endpoint software, an API, and a web interface.

The endpoint software is designed to take in the video feed and stream it to the main server, while also dealing with end-user authentication.
The server takes in camera feeds from the endpoints and stores them in a database, while also providing an API for the web interface to use. The server uses one-time token based authentication to ensure that the user is connecting to a known endpoint.
The web interface is designed to be a simple, easy to use interface for the user to view the camera feeds and modify settings. It is a shell for the functions exposed by the API.

All these are modular and can be swapped out with another solution, as long it does not include any breaking changes (unless they are dealt with in the other components as well).

## Authentication (Endpoint)
The authentication system is a token based system. The server generates a token and stores it in a database. The server's authentication endpoint is registered as an external authentication handler in the MediaMTX server which is being used to take in the RTSP streams. Whenever the endpoint wishes to connect to the server, it sends a request to the MediaMTX server with the token. The MediaMTX server forwards the authentication request to the Hub Server which then checks if the token is valid and if it is, it allows the endpoint to connect to the server. This token is then used to authenticate the endpoint for all future requests.

- [ ] In the future, a function that binds an endpoint to the token may be introduced, to ensure that a token can only be used by the endpoint it was first used by, to prevent token theft.

The endpoint `api/Auth` accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests.

**`GET`<br>**
The `GET` request is used to get all token from the server.

**`POST` <br>**
The `POST` request is used to verify a token and authenticate the user. It takes a payload with the schema
```json
{
  "ip": "string",
  "user": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "path": "string",
  "protocol": "string",
  "id": "string",
  "action": "string",
  "query": "string"
}
```
The `password` field is used to supply the token (it is named `password` to comply with the request that MediaMTX sends). <br>

Case | Response Code
---|---
Valid Token | 200
Invalid Token | 403
No Token | 401
Edge Case | 500

### Generating Tokens
The endpoint `/api/Auth/generateToken` can be used to generate a new token. A `POST` request is made to create a new token.
The `POST` request requires no body. This endpoint requries a JWT Bearer Token to be accessed. 
On successful request, a new token is generated and added to the SQLite database after being hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.
Case | Response Code
---|---
Token Generated | 200
Error | 500
Invalid JWT Token | 401

If the response is 200, the token is provided along with it.

---
## Authentication (API)
The HubAPI has certain protected endpoints which required a JWT Bearer Token to be accessed.
This token can be generated by performing a `GET` request to the endpoint`/api/Jwt`. The body must include a username and password in the following format:
```json
{
  "userName": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```
The response will be a JWT token which can be used to access the protected endpoints.

To access the protected endpoints, the token must be sent along with the request. Incase the authentication fails, a `401` response will be sent.


---
## Databases
The server uses a SQLite database to store data.

It is being accessed using the Entity Framework Core ORM.

The database int the repository is a *sample database* with a single token in it. It is **NOT** used in the actual server.

### SQL Schemas
**Endpoint Authentication Tokens**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Tokens
(
    Id           integer primary key autoincrement,
    CreationTime integer not null,
    AccessToken  TEXT    not null
);
```

**Users**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users
(
    Id       integer primary key autoincrement,
    Username TEXT    not null,
    Password TEXT    not null
);
```
